# JApps
Collection of day-to-day used apps centralized into one.

## What is this all about?
I've been using all kind of apps for my day-to-day life to manage time, tasks, todos, budget, read articles from RSS feeds, etc. All of them are great but always short one or two features, which I really need. Also they are all separated from each other, hard to move information from one to the other. That is why I want to create an all-in-app, which is tailored for my needs. So this multipurpose app will be my personal assistant with different sections to contain all my stuff which is not required to be shared with others. That's why I'm not planning a Calendar app, becaues it should be a social thingy. :)
