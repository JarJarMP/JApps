# JApps
Collection of day-to-day used apps centralized into one.

## What is this all about?
I've been using all kind of apps for my day-to-day life to manage time and todos, read articles in RSS feeds, etc. All of them are great but always short one or two features, which I really need. Also they are all separated from each other, hard to move information/data from one to the other. That's why I want to create an all-in-app, which is tailored for **my needs**. So where you see :+1:, that's a feature which will be implemented. :-1: for don't bother asking, :question: I'm thinking about it.

## Current status
I'm in the planning phase, writing down all the features for the apps. My goal is to create a common interface, unified UI where I can switch from to the other easy. Also a WordPress like installer is in plan too, for the non-tech people, who want to use it. That's why I will probably choose PHP+MySQL stack for the base, since most of the free hosting sites offer these.

## The Apps
 
### Calendar
Who am I kidding, just use [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/), that thing is awesome for calendar purposes! :)
